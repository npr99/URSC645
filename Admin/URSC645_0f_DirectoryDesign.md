# Directory and Folder Name Structure

## Admin 
The _Admin_ or Administration Folder has files and guides to introduce project. Folder may contain proposals, budgets, hiring documents, filename plans, directory design, etc.

## SourceData
The _SourceData_ folder contains data that many project members may want to use. The goal is to not have multiple copies of the same files. Also to preserve the original data and metadata. Subfolders within the _SourceData_ folder should be named to reflect the provenance of the data. For example, data from api.census.gov could be in a folder named `api.census.gov`

## Work[]
_Work_ folders will be found inside a project or task folder. _Work_ folder names include the initials of the person. For example, Nathanael’s work folders are named WorkNPR (work folder for Nathanael P. Rosenheim). _Work_ folders contain any files, documents, generated data… related to the specific project or task. _Work_ folders should also include a WorkLog file specific to the project or task.

## Posted
_Posted_ folder for files needed to replicate work that has been shared -- course assignment, journal article, conference paper -- or work shared internally for the team. Files in the _Posted_ folder should not be changed, do not run files in the _Posted_ folder. To run or edit a file in the _Posted_ folder, copy and paste into your personal _Work_ folder.

## Readings
_Readings_ folder contains readings related to the project.

## Archive
_Archive_ folders contains files that are no longer needed or have been superseded with a newer version. _Archive_ folders can be created inside your _Work_ folder to help clean up files.

## Note
Note on directory names Directory names should not contain spaces. Use Camel Case and/or underscores “_” to separate words.
