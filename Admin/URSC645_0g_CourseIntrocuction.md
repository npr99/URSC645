# URSC 645 — Course Introduction 👋

Welcome to **Urban & Regional Analytics / Reproducible Workflows**. This course is about learning to *work like a scientist*—organized, transparent, and reproducible—while building your own project step by step. 👍

---
## Why we’re here (the big picture) 🧭
We do research that other people can understand, run, and build on. That means:
- Clear folder structures.
- Version control and history you can actually find later.
- Code‑first, script‑everything.
- Document as you go (work logs!).
- Publish and let others try to replicate.

If you’re new to coding… that’s fine. If you’ve coded for years… great.

## How the assignments stack (ladder model) 🪜
- **Assignment 1** → scope + data + problem statement + research question.
- **Assignment 2** → cleaning + wrangling + merging + transforming.
- **Assignment 3** → describing + exploring + mapping + visualizing.
- **Final Project** → A1 + A2 + A3, refined and published.
- **Replication Challenge** → you try to replicate another student’s workflow.

---
## Tools we’ll use 🧰
- GitHub
- Visual Studio Code
- LinkedIn Learning
- GitHub Skills
- AI tools with transparency

---
## Work logs 🗒️
Keep a running log. I review on Tuesdays.

---
## Late work & life happens 💬
Talk to me. Extensions and incompletes are possible.

---
## Class vibe & expectations 🌱
You are future colleagues. Grades in Canvas, work in Google Drive and on GitHub.

---
## Coding: how we’ll learn 🧑‍💻
We won’t live-code all class. You’ll practice at home; in class we read code.

---
## Data workflow 🔁
Obtain → Clean → Explore/Visualize → Iterate. In this course we will not model data.

---
## Picking a project 🎯
Bring your idea, replicate a paper, or adopt lab work.

---
## Weekly rhythm 📆
Weeks 1–2 intro, Week 3 foundations, then coding + data for rest.

---
## AI policy 🤖
Use AI transparently.

## FAQ Added from AI acting like a Student Questions

### 1. How do we balance coding skills with using AI?
Early assignments are designed so you do not need AI. Build basic skills first. Use AI as a tutor: ask questions, request explanations, and verify your understanding.

### 2. How detailed should the workflow chart be for Assignment 1?
Show your input data files (usually 2+), expected cleaning steps, and expected exploration steps. High-level but clear.

### 3. Do I need all my datasets identified for Assignment 1?
Not necessarily. Most projects require at least two datasets. A common second dataset is census demographic or economic data.

### 4. How often should I commit changes to GitHub?
Commit often enough that commit messages clearly describe progress. Experimentation can be described in GitHub Issues rather than committed code.

### 5. When should I use GitHub Issues vs. my work log?
This is evolving. Use Issues to document experiments, errors, screenshots, and discussions. Use the work log to record your day-by-day progress. AI Agent in VS Code can be used to update issues with summaries of chat sessions.  

### 6. Should course repositories be public or private?
Instructor preference is public for transparency and replication, but GitHub Education allows students to make repos private.

### 7. How should I handle data that cannot be shared publicly?
Store raw data elsewhere. Include code that downloads or accesses the data. Keep shared files small (<100 MB) and follow data rights requirements.

# Data Storage and Sharing Guidelines for URSC 645

## GitHub File Size Rules
- Max file size: 100 MB (hard limit)
- Warning at 50 MB
- Repo size recommended < 1 GB

## Git LFS (Large File Storage)
- Allows files up to 2–5 GB depending on plan
- Free tier: 1 GB storage, 1 GB/month bandwidth

## Best Practices
- Store raw data outside the repo.
- Use scripts to download or load data.
- Use GitHub for code, documentation, workflow.
- Use external repositories (DesignSafe, Zenodo, etc.) for large data.

## Course Recommendation
Prefer publicly available or shareable datasets. Provide the full workflow and code so results can be reproduced.
