# Set up a good workstation
---
A good workstation can help make the data workflow process easier - the more monitor workspace the better. Here is an example of a healthy workspace:

The vertical monitor is nice for viewing PDF Files and Word Documents, the middle wide monitor is useful for having multiple program files open side-by-side and the small laptop monitor is good for viewing the file explorer. 

The window behind my monitor helps remind me to look up and outside - which helps reduce eye strain.

The monitors provide a total of over 4.7 sq feet of workspace.
- 12x21 vertical monitor = 252 sq inches
- 12x27 wide monitor = 324 sq inches
- 13.5x7.5 laptop monitor = 101.25 sq inches

Also good to have an:
- Ergonomic keyboard 
- Ergonomic mouse (https://www.amazon.com/Posturite-Ambidextrous-Alleviates-Easy-Glide-Compatible/dp/B007GFYM1K)
- Lamp
- Bright window
- Comfortable work chair

27" Dell Monitor, a desk, and an ergonomic chair, docking station, keyboard, webcam, and ergonomic mouse. Total investment around $1,100.

"I have a lot of space to work comfortably now, and the chair helps me reduce my back pain." - Student Testimonial

Note: A filename can include several periods or decimal characters “.”. 
However, it is good practice to not use periods or decimals in filenames. 
A full filename includes the filename with a decimal followed by the file extension. Common file extensions include:
```
.txt = Plain text file
.docx = Microsoft Word file
.pptx = Microsoft Powerpoint file
.csv = Comma separated value file
.rtf = Rich Text File
.do = Stata do file (batch file) [Plain text file]
.py = Python code file [Plain text file]
.ipynb = Jupyter Notebook file
.dta = Stata Data file
```
