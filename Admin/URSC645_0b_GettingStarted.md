## Tips

### Set up a good workstation
---
A good workstation can help make the data workflow process easier - the more monitor workspace the better. Here is an example of a healthy workspace:

The vertical monitor is nice for viewing PDF Files and Word Documents, the middle wide monitor is useful for having multiple program files open side-by-side and the small laptop monitor is good for viewing the file explorer. 

The window behind my monitor helps remind me to look up and outside - which helps reduce eye strain.

The monitors provide a total of over 4.7 sq feet of workspace.
- 12x21 vertical monitor = 252 sq inches
- 12x27 wide monitor = 324 sq inches
- 13.5x7.5 laptop monitor = 101.25 sq inches

Also good to have an:
- Ergonomic keyboard 
- Ergonomic mouse (https://www.amazon.com/Posturite-Ambidextrous-Alleviates-Easy-Glide-Compatible/dp/B007GFYM1K)
- Lamp
- Bright window
- Comfortable work chair

27" Dell Monitor, a desk, and an ergonomic chair, docking station, keyboard, webcam, and ergonomic mouse. Total investment around $1,100.

"I have a lot of space to work comfortably now, and the chair helps me reduce my back pain." - Student Testimonial

Note: A filename can include several periods or decimal characters “.”. 
However, it is good practice to not use periods or decimals in filenames. 
A full filename includes the filename with a decimal followed by the file extension. Common file extensions include:
```
.txt = Plain text file
.docx = Microsoft Word file
.pptx = Microsoft Powerpoint file
.csv = Comma separated value file
.rtf = Rich Text File
.do = Stata do file (batch file) [Plain text file]
.py = Python code file [Plain text file]
.ipynb = Jupyter Notebook file
.dta = Stata Data file
```

### View Directory Details 
Try viewing folders and files using directory details in Windows or list layout view in Google Drive. (not sure what the option is within Mac OS) These views may make it easier to navigate complicated folder structures and see detailed file names.
