# 🚀 Set up Your GitHub Account

Welcome to the world of collaborative coding! 🎉 

We'll use GitHub throughout this course for assignments and projects. GitHub is like the "social media for code" - it's an incredible platform that helps you:

- 📁 **Organize your projects** with reproducible workflows
- 🤝 **Collaborate seamlessly** with classmates and researchers worldwide  
- 🔍 **Track changes** and never lose your work again
- 🌟 **Build your professional portfolio** that employers love to see

In this course, GitHub is not just a place to turn things in — it is where your work, decisions, and experiments live over time.

## ✅ Step 1: Create Your Account

🎯 **Your Mission**: Create a GitHub account you can comfortably use as a working research space this semester. This account does not need to be perfect, impressive, or polished. It needs to be usable.

**Once your account is ready, optimize your profile like a pro:**

### 🌟 Profile Basics (Good Enough Is Enough)
- 📸 **Add a professional photo** (or fun avatar that represents you!)
- ✍️ **Write a compelling bio** - mention your field of study, interests, and goals
- 📍 **Add your location** (city/region is fine for privacy)
- 🔗 **Link your website/portfolio** if you have one
- 📧 **Use your school email** for credibility
- 🏢 **Add your university/organization**

**📝 Bio Examples:**
- "Urban planning student passionate about data-driven city solutions 🏙️"
- "Researcher exploring spatial analysis and community development 📊"
- "Future urban planner combining GIS and social justice 🗺️✊"

💡 Your profile does not need to look like a job application.
A simple bio that identifies you as a student or researcher is sufficient.

## 🔐 Step 3: Secure Your Account

🛡️ **Safety First!** Protect your work with these essential security steps:

1. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - Go to Settings > Password and authentication > Two-factor authentication
   - Use your phone or an authenticator app
   - 🎯 This prevents hackers from accessing your account even if they get your password!

2. **Use a Strong, Unique Password**
   - Consider using a password manager
   - Never reuse your GitHub password elsewhere

3. **Review Your Security Settings**
   - Check which apps have access to your account
   - Set up recovery options

## 📚 Essential GitHub Vocabulary

Master these key terms - they're the building blocks of GitHub success! 💪

| Term | What It Means | Why You Care |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Repository (Repo)** 📁 | A project folder containing all your files and history | Your digital workspace for each project |
| **Fork** 🍴 | Your personal copy of someone else's repository | Lets you experiment without breaking the original |
| **Commit** 💾 | Saving a snapshot of your changes with a descriptive message | Creates a timeline of your project's evolution |
| **Push** ⬆️ | Uploading your local changes to GitHub | Shares your work with the world |
| **Pull** ⬇️ | Downloading the latest changes from GitHub | Keeps you up-to-date with collaborators |
| **Pull Request** 🙋‍♀️ | Proposing your changes to be merged into a project | How you contribute to team projects |
| **Branch** 🌿 | A parallel version of your project for trying new features | Lets you experiment safely |

In this course, GitHub Issues and Discussions often replace email for technical questions or progress notes. This keeps context attached to the work itself.
