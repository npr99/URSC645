# Introduction to Work Logs 
A work log is an important tool for documenting your work. A work log is in the spirit of a laboratory notebook (Kenare, 1985), which is used by scientists and engineers to document their work in great detail. Writing in a work log helps the researcher to stop and think about what they are working on. Too often researchers can be caught up in the moment and forget to document their work. "Writing good notes requires discipline and practice. It is a skill that does not come easily to most people." (Kanare, 1985, p. 13)

A work log provides a means for keeping track and documenting the work accomplished on a project. Think of the work log as a diary of your efforts. The work log is for the individual researcher and provides a way to communicate with colleagues. 

The work log can be organized in many ways. In general it is best to have a work log for each project or task. A recommendation is to use a digital file that allows for adding screenshots of issues, notes on work, notes from meetings, and successes or complaints.

### GitHub Issues Work Log:
I have found that using GitHub Issues is a great way to keep track of work and streamline the Work Log process. Here is an example of work logs that track the effort to complete a LinkedIn Learning Course of Python.

### Google Drive Work Logs:
Google Docs is an excellent option for keeping a work log. Google Docs provide a way to tag colleagues with issues, questions, or to assign tasks to colleagues.

### Ideas for organization
- Name your Work Log with the project mnemonic_WorkLOG[Initials].
- Set up your work log so that the top entry is the current date and the first entry is at the bottom.
- Keep the work log simple - it does not have to be written in a formal style or be a polished document.

### Example Work Log:

## Work Log for Nathanael Rosenheim - URSC 645 Tasks

### Jan 13, 2026 - How to add screenshots to work log (or GitHub Issue)

I love adding screenshots to my Worklogs and to GitHub Issues. Above is a quick guide for Mac or PC.

### Jan 25, 2024 - creating example work log
On the course GitHub page I have added an example of a work log entry. Work log entries provide a short summary of what has been completed. In general each entry is under a specific date. If a lot of work is done in one day it can be helpful to have multiple entries for that day. A work log can include snippets of code, screen shots, and links to other documents.

### Jan 24, 2024 - How to organize by date
Work logs can be kept in Google Docs (preferable), a Word Document, or a text file. The work log will grow over time with new entries starting at the top of the file. Work logs should be created for different projects. For example, I have a work log for each class I teach. I also have a work log for each research project I am working on.

Mentioned by Scott Long 2009 in section about documentation.
Turns out to be a good summary of research notebooks - from the perspective of a chemist but seems general enough in principle for any scientist
