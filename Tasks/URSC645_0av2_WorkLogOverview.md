# Introduction to Work Logs 📓

A work log is an important tool for documenting your work. A work log is in the spirit of a laboratory notebook (Kanare, 1985), which is used by scientists and engineers to document their work in great detail. Writing in a work log helps the researcher to stop and think about what they are working on. Too often researchers can be caught up in the moment and forget to document their work. As Kanare notes, "Writing good notes requires discipline and practice. It is a skill that does not come easily to most people." (Kanare, 1985, p. 13)

A work log provides a means for keeping track of and documenting the work accomplished on a project. Think of the work log as a diary of your efforts and a record of your decision-making. The work log is for the individual researcher, but it also provides a way to communicate with colleagues, collaborators, and (in this class) with me.

> **💡 Tacit expectation (made explicit):** The work log is not a productivity report and it is not a polished deliverable. It is a thinking space, a memory aid, and a communication tool.

## Types of Work Logs 📂

The work log can be organized in many ways. In general, it is best to have a work log for each project or task. In this class, you will typically maintain at least two work logs:

- **Tasks work log** (for course setup, exercises, and logistics)
- **Project work log** (for your individual research project)

A strong recommendation is to use a digital file that allows for adding screenshots of issues, notes on work, notes from meetings, links to code or repositories, and short reflections on what worked and what did not.

> **🎯 Tacit expectation (made explicit):** If something does not work, that is not a failure. Documenting why it did not work is often more valuable than documenting a success.

## GitHub Issues Work Log 🐙

I have found that using GitHub Issues is a great way to keep track of work and streamline the work log process, especially for coding-heavy or collaborative projects. GitHub Issues make it easy to:

- Document problems and error messages
- Link directly to code or commits
- See a chronological record of decisions

Here is an example of work logs that track the effort to complete a LinkedIn Learning course on Python:

> **✨ Tacit expectation (made explicit):** GitHub Issues are not just for "bugs." They can be used for questions, experiments, partial ideas, and notes to your future self.

## Google Drive Work Logs ☁️

Google Docs is an excellent option for keeping a work log and is what we will use most often in this class. Google Docs provide a way to:

- Add screenshots
- Insert links to files or GitHub repositories
- Tag colleagues with questions or issues
- Communicate asynchronously using comments

In this class, I regularly read your work logs and leave comments directly in them. If you reply to a comment, I receive a notification, which makes the work log one of our primary communication channels.

> **👁️ Tacit expectation (made explicit):** If it is not documented in your work log, I cannot see it and cannot give you feedback on it.


## Ideas for Organization 🗂️

- **Name** your work log with the project mnemonic followed by _WorkLog[Initials]
- **Put** the most recent entry at the top of the document
- **Use dates** as headings (e.g., ## 2026-01-25) so the document outline can be used for navigation
- **Create** multiple entries for that day if you do multiple distinct tasks
- **Keep** the work log simple—it does not need to be written in a formal style or read like a report

> **🎯 Tacit expectation (made explicit):** A good work log entry often answers three questions:
> - What did I try?
> - What happened (including errors or surprises)?
> - What do I plan to do next?


## What to Include in a Work Log Entry 📝

A work log entry may include:

- A short summary of what you worked on
- Screenshots of error messages or results
- Snippets of code or links to scripts/notebooks
- Notes on AI tools used (including prompts and outcomes)
- Estimates of time spent
- Reflections such as "this took longer than expected" or "this part was confusing"

> **✍️ Tacit expectation (made explicit):** It is perfectly acceptable to write an entry that says you opened the files, got stuck, and did not make progress. Honesty and transparency matter more than speed.

## Example Work Log 💼

### Work Log for Nathanael Rosenheim – URSC 645 Tasks

**Jan 13, 2026** – How to add screenshots to work log (or GitHub Issue)
- Create Screenshot and paste into an issue
- I love adding screenshots to my work logs and to GitHub Issues. Screenshots are often the fastest way to communicate what is happening, especially when dealing with technical problems.

**Jan 25, 2024** – Creating example work log
- On the course GitHub page, I added an example of a work log entry. Work log entries provide a short summary of what has been completed. In general, each entry is under a specific date. If a lot of work is done in one day, it can be helpful to have multiple entries for that day. A work log can include snippets of code, screenshots, and links to other documents.

**Jan 24, 2024** – How to organize by date
- Work logs can be kept in Google Docs (preferred), a Word document, or a text file. The work log will grow over time with new entries starting at the top of the file. Work logs should be created for different projects. For example, I have a work log for each class I teach and a separate work log for each research project I am working on.

> **📚 Tacit expectation (made explicit):** Maintaining separate work logs makes it much easier to switch between projects without losing context.

## Why We Use Work Logs in This Class 🎓

In this course, work logs serve several purposes at once:

- They document your learning process
- They support reproducibility and transparency
- They allow me to give targeted feedback
- They help you build habits you can reuse in your dissertation and future research

Your grade is based primarily on what is documented in your work log. I am not grading you on perfection or speed. I am grading you on effort, reflection, and clarity of process.

## Work Log Rubric: How I Will Read Your Log 📋

### Overall Judgment 🎯

Strong work logs make effort, thinking, and decisions visible. Weak work logs make activity hard to interpret. When in doubt, document more rather than less.

### Weekly Work Log Rubric (Used for Check-In Reviews) ⭐

**Exceeds expectations** 🌟
- Entries are clear and easy to interpret
- Screenshots, error messages, notes, and links make it obvious what you tried, what happened, and why decisions were made
- AI tools or external resources are acknowledged when used
- I can quickly understand your thinking and your workflow

**Meets expectations** ✅
- Entries document what you worked on and provide enough context to understand progress
- Some supporting evidence (notes, links, screenshots) is present, though details may be uneven
- Effort and decisions are visible

**Needs improvement** 🔍
- Entries exist but are hard to interpret
- Limited context, missing links, or minimal explanation make it difficult to understand what happened or why
- Documentation is incomplete

**No evidence** ❌
- Little or no work log activity for the period
- Entries provide no meaningful information about effort, process, or decisions

### AI Use Summary 🤖

**Models:** Claude Haiku 4.5 in VS Code and Microsoft 365 Copilot (GPT‑5–based chat model).

MS Copilot revised the original task file and Nathanael Rosenheim worked with the AI as a writing and reflection partner, not as an automated author. AI was used to help surface tacit expectations expressed verbally in lectures and translate them into clearer written guidance, while preserving my original wording, structure, and intent.

AI support focused on summarizing lecture transcripts, identifying recurring themes about work‑log 
expectations, and helping refine a weekly rubric aligned with how I actually review logs. All content was reviewed, edited, and approved by the instructor.

In VS Code, Nathanael Rosenheim copied and pasted the Copilot Page (which lost the formatting) Claude reformatted the entire document by adding clear headings and adding contextual emojis. Prompts asked to: (1) reformat with headings, bold/indent tacit expectations, and add emojis, (2) improve the rubric section formatting, and (3) create this AI use summary.
