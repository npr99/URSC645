| In-Text Citation | Workflow Defined |
| --- | --- |
| Freese (2007) | Workflow is defined as the sequence of steps involved in conducting a research study, from data collection to analysis and reporting of results. |
| Long (2009) | The data analysis workflow is described as a continuous process with four stages: data cleaning, analysis, results presentation, and file saving, each requiring planning, organization, documentation, and execution. |
| White et al (2013) | Workflow is framed as a planned process starting from the data collection stage to ensure reusability. |
| Gentzkow and Shapiro (2014) Ch. 2 | Workflow is characterized as the transition from a manual, step-by-step process to a scripted pipeline where data building and analysis are stored in code. |
| Christensen et al (2019) | Workflow is defined as the combination of data, code, organization, and documentation. |

### Summary: How Has the Definition of Workflow Evolved?

Across the literature, workflow is consistently framed as the organized sequence of steps and practices that carry a research project from data collection through analysis to outputs. The definition begins as a process description and gradually expands to emphasize automation and the integration of data, code, and documentation.

**Early definitions (2007-2009)** emphasize workflow as a sequence of steps and stages. Freese (2007) defines workflow as the steps of a research study, while Long (2009) describes a continuous, multi-stage process that requires planning and documentation. In this period, workflow is largely about **structure and order** in analysis.

**By 2013-2014**, the definition becomes more **procedural and technical**. White et al (2013) frame workflow as a planned process starting at data collection to ensure reusability. Gentzkow and Shapiro (2014) add a more operational focus, defining workflow as a shift to scripted pipelines where analysis is stored in code. This highlights automation and reproducibility as core workflow goals.

**By 2019**, workflow is defined more broadly as a **system of components**. Christensen et al (2019) describe workflow as the combination of data, code, organization, and documentation, moving beyond steps to include the full research environment and its artifacts.

**Key areas of agreement:**
- Workflow involves an ordered sequence of research steps
- Planning, organization, and documentation are essential
- Workflow should support reproducibility and reusability

**Key areas of evolution:**
- From describing steps to emphasizing automation and scripted pipelines
- From focusing on process alone to including data, code, and documentation as core workflow components

In summary, workflow definitions have broadened over time. The concept shifted from a step-by-step process to an integrated system that includes code, data, and documentation, with automation increasingly treated as a defining feature.

This page was generated on **February 10, 2026** using **GitHub Copilot (GPT-5.2-Codex)** through a **VS Code GitHub Copilot Pro Education License**.

The following prompt was used in sequence:

1. **Create workflow definitions file:** "Follow the structure of the reproducible file and create a new file for the definitions of workflow."

The AI reviewed the full contents of [00_URSC645_AnnotatedBibliography.md](00_URSC645_AnnotatedBibliography.md) to identify and extract definitions of "workflow" from each article entry, then consolidated them into the table above and summarized agreements and evolution over time.
