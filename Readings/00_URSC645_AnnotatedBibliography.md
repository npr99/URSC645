# Annotated Bibliography

## Introduction

This annotated bibliography highlights the following ideas and concepts as discussed in the literature:

1. Definitions of terms such as reproducible, replicable, workflow, science
2. Challenges associated with reproducible research
    - Social norms vs individual goals - tradeoffs
3. Computer coding, scripting, and programming concepts
4. Appropriate software for replicable research
5. Discussions of bias (what is better science?)

## The Problem

Research is a fundamental part of science that involves a significant investment of time, systematic application of methods, and careful consideration. 
"Science demands reproducibility" (Long 2009, p. 2); therefore, reproducible research is a fundamental part of science. 
However, most research is not reproducible because many of the research methods are not clearly documented, and tools or software are not always available.
Additionally, within the social sciences, there is a general sense while research should be reproducible, the requirements are left to individual researchers.
To overcome the gap between the demand for reproducible research and the lack of skills to build reproducibility into projects, researchers need to invest time to develop data science skills. Data science skills can help build a strong workflow to support urban and regional analytic research that is systematic, generalizable, and replicable. 
Researchers who invest time to develop skills for reproducible research will be able to accomplish better science in less time.

## Research Question:

_How do reproducible workflow skills affect the quality and efficiency of science?_

The research question defines the sections to focus on in the literature review. Within each article review look for definitions and ways to measure the following terms:
1. reproducible
2. workflow 
3. workflow skills
4. quality of science
5. efficiency of science

## Audience

This annotated bibliography is for academic researchers interested in reproducible research.

## Munafo et al 2017
Munafò, M. R., Nosek, B. A., Bishop, D. V., Button, K. S., Chambers, C. D., du Sert, N. P., Simonsohn, U., Wagenmakers, E., Ware, J.J., & Ioannidis, J. P. (2017). A manifesto for reproducible science. Nature Human Behaviour, 1, 0021. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0021 

In their article, Munafò et al. (2017) provide a strong argument for why reproducible science is important. The authors describe the potential for various forms of bias to lead to self-deception. Broadly, the areas to address are with individual scientists, the availability of large datasets and potential for rapid data analysis, and systems that do not incentivize transparent research. The authors argue that currently reproducibility and transparency are not the norms in social science, but that the benefits will lead to an eventual shift in the culture.

Practices such as blinding, pre-regristration, and continuing education in modular form are provided as ways to reduce bias, improve transparency and reproducibility. There are numerous resources that could help encourage transparency and reproducibility.

Freese defines replicate as " the simple verification or duplication of results using the same data and analytic procedures as the original researcher." (p. 154) Freese points out within Sociology there is an implicit individualistic policy that all published research should be replicable. Freese argues that the responsibility to do replicate research should be based on a social contract.

| Individual policy | Social policy |
| --- | --- |
| If asked a researcher should be able to provide the files to replicate published results | Files to replicate published results are submitted at time of publication. |
| emphasis on trust over transparency, faith in the author, reinforcement of status, ethically obscure, expires with the individual | Reduce egalitarianism. Distributes power and access. Openness. Highlights exemplary work. |

## Lowndes et al 2017

Lowndes, J. S. S., Best, B. D., Scarborough, C., Afflerbach, J. C., Frazier, M. R., O’Hara, C. C., Jiang, N., & Halpern, B. S. (2017). Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. Nature Ecology & Evolution, 1(6), 0160. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-017-0160 

In Lowndes et al., 2017, the authors discuss their reasoning and process for how they reevaluated and overhauled their approach to data management and collaboration. After publishing their initial report (Ocean Health Index), when they attempted to reproduce their methods for the second report, they realized that the team varied in their approaches to data management style, and versioning, and recreating their methods easily was impossible. They elected to all use one systematic approach to data management, collectively learning the R programming language and using Git and GitHub for their file management and collaboration. They discovered that not only did the new system improve their management, it also improved their team collaboration and overall productivity because everyone had the same base knowledge about the process and language of the data management code and programs. This allowed for better vetting of the data entry and written code for errors. Over time as they incorporate more methods for improving the workflow, the overall time they must spend working on generating the annual report decreases, indicating that the methods are creating efficient work that is still accurate and does not require retooling.

"Integrating open data science practices and tools into science can save time, while also improving reproducibility for our most important collaborators: our future selves." - Lowndes et al

### Introduction

Lowndes provides a methodological account of the open data tools that they use to improve their workflow (i.e. data preparation, modeling, coding, collaboration and sharing data).

### Argument

It is often implied that good science is science that is reproducible. One of the main challenges across disciplines is making data accessible, transparent and collaborative. The author introduces various open data science tools that can make the process of reproducibility and collaboration easier. Shifting from an individual to collaborative approach to data analysis is beneficial by allowing for analysis and interpretation to become a collaborative learning process resulting in individual and collective growth and improvement.

### Audience

An experienced community of data analysts and researchers interested in collaboration and improving methodology through collaboration.

### Content

Lowndes walks us through a number of methods and tools that her and collaborative research partners use to improve their workflow and the reproducibility of their work. Table 1 provided a summary of workflow tasks, primary open data tools and how tools have advanced to make workflow more efficient. For example, every time R Markdown output files are regenerated, the R code is rerun and the associated text and figures are also regenerated to reflect any updates to the code. Another resource they used was Git 44 as a version control system tool (which tracks changes within files and allows you to revert to previous version if needed). It takes snapshots of the changes being made line-by-line and throughout time.

1. Definition not mentioned.
2. Software usually creates barriers between researchers and restrains data sharing, because of the cost of software researchers use in their research. Further, individual data organizations place challenges in reproducing research. Workflow and sharing data organization is essential to overcome replicable research challenges.
3. Free software helps establish workflow and sharing data. Establishing workflow and sharing data improve data replicability, which cannot be based on individual data organization.
4. How free software tools and platforms can help collaborative research, improving workflow, and replicability. It uses an Ocean Health Index project as an example of replicability and collaboration research.Open sources also help reproducibility.
5. Emphasis on reproducibility, collaboration, and communication

### Argument:

Free software tools and platforms, like Github, can help collaborative research, improving workflow, and replicability, because it breaks the barriers between researchers.


## Gentzkow and Shapiro (2014)
Gentzko, M., & Shapiro, J.N. (2014). Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner’s Guide. https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf

Purpose of book: To share "insight from experts in code & data into practical terms." The whole book focused on workflow skills. 

### Chapter 1 - Introduction

**Key Words**: 
Empirical social science: "Asking good questions. Digging up novel data. Designing statistical analysis. Writing up results. For many of us, most of the time, what it means is writing & debugging code…” .pg 3 
Reproducible - no definition
workflow - no definition
quality of science - no definition
efficiency of science - no definition

**Summary**:
Authors provide an observation that many social scientists do have some programming basics, but overall they lack a formal computer science training. This lack of formal training approach that social scientists use has limitations as "projects grow bigger, the problems grew nastier, and our piecemeal efforts at improving matters... proved ever more ineffective" (pg 4). Important limitations or challenges from this approach include: replication, unexpected data changes, inefficiency in the researcher code, or clarity. 

### Chapter 2 - Automation
Key Words: 
**Rules:**
1. Automate everything that can be automated 
2. Write a single script that executes all code from beginning to end. 
have recommendations on Stata code on page 8 and 9 related to this chapter topic

**Summary:**
The Interactive mode of research - save/modify as you go without thinking long term - is bad for 2 reasons:
Replicability: Lacks a "record of the precise steps taken" or "definition of what anything means”. 
Efficiency: In the interactive mode there are no “scripting key steps” nor a project directory to organize the project for yourself and others. 
The authors recommend automating as much as possible. 

Introduces the reader to the potato chip and TV method that runs the length of the book. 

### Chapter 3 - Version Control
**Recommended Resources:**
* Version Control Resources 
* Sub Version 
* Tortviso SNV for Windows 
* Git or Bit Buckets

Key Words: 
**Rules:**
1. Store code and data under version control 
2. Run the whole directory before checking it back in 

**Summary:**
Using dates to indicate a file version is not enough because 1) it is hard to know "when to ‘spawn’ a new version and when to edit the old one." (12 pg) and 2) it generates 
confusion because the naming of the file is also not clear. 

The authors recommend using a version control method. On your PC, you create a repository or remote server. When you want to modify a directory, you check it out, make your edits & changes. Then you run the entire directory to make sure it works. Make corrections if needed. Once it's complete, you check the directory back in. 
Version control also comes with a work long so you can see who made changes and revert if needed. 
A common version control users are familiar with is Google Docs. 

### Chapter 4 - Directories

**Key Words:**
* Rundirectory.bat: single script that executes a directory from start to finish
* /temp
* /output
**Rules:**
1. Separate directories by function.
2. Separate files into inputs and outputs.
3. Make directories portable.

**Summary:**
Separating directories by purpose makes it easier to intentionally modify the encapsulated analysis without having to rerun all the unrelated scripts, and it makes it possible to use local references. To get around this set-up breaking on a different machine where the local links are not valid, one can link to fixed revisions of the dataset on shared network storage, which the user can then decide to update once they are satisfied with the new revision.

### Chapter 5 - Keys

**Key Words:**
* Relational database: a database format whose physical structure communicates the logic behind it to be self-documenting
* Table: rectangular arrays in which data are stored
* Element: The row of a table
* Variable: the column of a table, which is an attribute of the table’s elements
* Key:  a variable or set of variables that uniquely identifies the elements of a table. The variables that form the key never take on missing values, and a key’s value is never duplicated across rows of the table
* Foreign key: the key for another table in the database
* Normalized: a form of data that is easier to understand because the data are organized to be similar across all records
**Rules:**
1. Store cleaned data in tables with unique, non-missing keys.
2. Keep data normalized as far into your code pipeline as you can.

**Summary:**
Managing complex datasets is possible, and it begins with ensuring that “the physical structure of a database \[communicates]\ its logical structure” (19). The authors illustrate this by creating a toy relational database of the effect of television on potato chip consumption in New York and Virginia, in which the authors normalize the data. To perform an analysis on a relational database, the tables of the database must be merged (joined) into a single array, at which point the data will likely no longer be normalized. The authors describe this process using their toy relational database.

### Chapter 6 - Abstraction

**Key Words:**
* Abstraction: turning the specific instances of something into a general-purpose tool
**Rules:**
1. Abstract to eliminate redundancy.
2. Abstract to improve clarity.
3. Otherwise, don’t abstract.

**Summary:**
Copying and pasting code can propagate errors. A less error-prone alternative is abstraction, developing general-purpose code (e.g., functions, classes, scripts, etc.) that can cleanly be applied to the specific situation of interest as well as to future projects. Abstraction eliminates redundancy and makes code more readable. However, be sure to double-check that the abstraction works as intended and to not abstract without a purpose.

### Chapter 7 - Documentation

**Key Words:**
* Commenting code
* Documentation
Rules:
1. Don’t write documentation you will not maintain.
2. Code should be self-documenting.

**Summary:**
Over-commenting code is an issue if the code is later changed but the comment is not updated; in this scenario, the comment no longer accurately reflects the code. The authors state, “If it’s not worth maintaining a piece of documentation up to [standard], it probably isn’t worth writing it in the first place (rule [1])” (27). Thus to make code clear without extensive comments, the authors suggest making code self-documenting (rule 2) by guiding the reader through the code through descriptive variable names and easily read code structure. This self-documentation is applicable to more than just code (e.g., purpose of relational databases, filenames etc.). While documenting can help prevent unintended behavior (through a written warning), it is often more effective to create preventative code that doesn’t allow the unintended behavior.

### Chapter 8 - Management

**Key Words:**
* Task management system: “systems that enforce organized communication and reporting about tasks.” pg. 32 
* Collaborative note-taking environment : “a place to jot down thoughts or display results that are less structured than the code… but more permanent than an e-mail or conversation.”
**Rules:**
* Manage tasks with a task management system.
* E-mail is not a task management system.

**Summary:**
Task management issues propagate with bigger teams. Using a task management system for collaboration can reduce ambiguity about tasks, goals, and assignments. These systems also store task-specific records of “who did what and why” (33). The authors recommend Asana (www.asana.com), Wrike (www.wrike.com), and Flow (www.getflow.com) as good free options, although the authors use a paid program called JIRA. The authors also recommend using a collaborative note-taking environment to develop and share project notes such as Evernote (www.evernote.com - free) or OneNote (included in Microsoft Office).

### Appendix - Code Style

**Key Words:**
* Slow code: code that one plans to rarely change

**Principles of writing good code:**
1. Keep it short and purposeful.
2. Make your functions shy.
       a. Functions should explicitly declare inputs and outputs and only operate on local variables.
3. Order your functions for linear reading.
4. Use descriptive names.
5. Pay special attention to coding algebra.
    a. Make sure that key calculations are clearly set off from the rest of the code.
    b. Break complicated algebraic calculations into pieces.
6. Make logical switches intuitive.
7. Be consistent.
8. Check for errors.
9. Write tests for just about every piece of code to make sure that the code does everything it is expected to do.
10. Profile slow code relentlessly.
11. Store “too much” output from slow code.
12. Separate slow code from fast code.

1. The paper introduces a new lexicon for research reproducibility. (a) Methods reproducibility, the provision of enough detail about research procedures (e.g. how many analyses were performed) and data. (b) Results reproducibility refers to obtainings the same results from a conduct of an independent study whose procedures are as close as possible. (c) Inferential reproducibility refers to drawing the same conclusions from an either independent study or a reanalysis of the original study.
2. The article points out some of its basic terms - reproducibility, replicability, reliability, robustness, and generalizability - are not standardized, leading to both conceptual and operational confusion.
3. Not mentioned
4. Not mentioned
5. Conclusion: Ill-defined reproducibility can be improved by a clear specification of reproducibility (methods, results, or inferences) and how it affects knowledge.

### Argument

The researchers need to move toward a better understanding of the relationship between reproducibility, cumulative evidence, and the truth of scientific claims.

## Long (2009) - The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata

### Chapter 1 & 2
This book emphasizes that a **good workflow is essential for the replication of research, which is a cornerstone of good science**. The author argues that researchers often develop workflows ad hoc, learning from mistakes. Chapters 1 and 2 introduce a structured approach to data analysis, highlighting the importance of planning, organization, and documentation (PO&D).  **Replicability is the guiding principle**, and the book stresses that workflow should facilitate this. **Improved workflow leads to greater efficiency, accuracy, and the avoidance of errors**, ultimately improving the quality of scientific work.

### Chapter 3

Problem: In this chapter, Long (2009) discusses the importance of writing and debugging do-files. Each of the tools he provides contribute to the accuracy, replicability, and efficiency of your work. While there may be a time investment in learning these tools, it will quickly be recovered as they are applied to the work being done. When conducting research, we often run into errors. We must know how to diagnose any arising issues. Long argues that the most effective way to submit commands is with do-files, which is a primary form of documentation.

The primary research question in this chapter:
- Can you (or how do you) run a do-file without running into any errors and producing the same results?

Definitions:

Do-file: Do-files are simply text files that contain your commands (Long, p. 49)

Robust: A do-file that produce exactly the same result when run at a later time or on another computer (Long, p. 51)

Legible: A do-file that is documented and formatted so that it is easy to understand what is being done (Long, p. 51)

Long suggests that the reproducibility can be measured by the following:
- Understanding how to execute commands
- Writing effective do-files
- Debugging do-files

In previous chapters, long has emphasized the importance of a good workflow. In this chapter, he states that “part of an effective workflow is taking advantage of the powerful features of your software” (Long, p. 47).

Some of the workflow skills discussed relate to writing effective do-files. More specifically, he suggest that do-files should be robust and legible. There are detailed instructions on how to make sure they fit this criteria  (Long, p. 51).

The quality of science can be assessed by ensuring the quality of do-files and knowing how to debug them in case of errors.

For the efficiency of science, he suggests having templates for do-files. “The more uniform your do-files are, the less likely you are to make errors and the easier it will be to read your output (Long, p. 63).

The Command Window: Long goes into detail about the interface of Stata and gives suggestions for how to execute commands, such as the review window, variables window, etc. (Pg. 48). One way to do that is with dialog boxes. These are drop down functions in the main Stata interface that allow you to execute commands. However, he highly suggests executing commands with a do-file. He states that 99% of the work he does in Stata uses do-files (Long, p. 49). The importance of this is that 1) it keeps a record of the commands  you ran, and 2) you can use features of your text editor, including copying, pasting, global changes, and much more.

In order to replicate and correctly interpret results, they must be robust and legible (Long, p. 51).

To make a do-file robust, they must meet the following:
- Need to be self-contained – it should use the dataset that is loaded. The do-file should not rely on something left in memory by a prior do-file or command.
- Use version control – this is done to ensure a newer version of Stata computes the commands correctly (e.g., you run a do-file that was created on an older Stata version)
- Exclude directory information – this is done so that you can run do-files on other computers without any changes since data will not always stay in the same place (you will possibly move the data over the years)

To make a do-file legible, Long suggest the following:
- Use lots of comments. For example, if you start a line with *, everything that follows is treated as a comment. You can also use // and comments as dividers.
- Use short lines. Having lines (e.g. commands) that are too long cause problems.
- Limit your abbreviations
- Have command abbreviations (see image below)
- Most importantly, be consistent! You will make fewer errors if you have a standard way to do things. This applied to the style of your do-files. 

![image](https://github.com/jason805sm/URSC645/assets/158380929/290b2ebd-7535-4433-8f85-61d43bc61053)

One of the more important suggestions Long makes it to have a template for do-files (Long, p. 63). He provides suggestions for things that should be included in your template from creating a simple do more to a more complex one (Long, p. 65).

In practice, your do-files will run into errors. It is imperative that we have solutions for how to debug them (Long, p. 68). Long provides instructions for fixing simple errors in do-files and how to fix them: it is likely that the a0 log file is open, b) log file already exists, c) incorrect variable name, d) incorrect command name, e) incorrect option, or f) missing comma before options.

He also provides steps for resolving errors (Long, p. 70). He gives general strategies that we should consider if we do not see an obvious solution for the error code encountered: Step 1 is to update Stata and user written programs (including the do-file). Step 2 is to start with a clean slate, which consists of not leaving any information in the memory, restarting Stata if necessary, rebooting your computer, etc. (Long, p. 71). Step 3 is to try other data. Step 4 is to assume everything could be wrong. Step 5 is to run the program in steps. Step 6 is to exclude parts of the do-file. Step 7 is to start over (e.g., throw out the original code, use a new file). Step 8 is to know that sometimes it is not your mistake – it could be possible that there is an error in Stata.

Long also provides instructions on debugging syntax errors (Long, p. 75, unanticipated results (Long, p. 77), and more advanced methods for debugging (Long, p. 81). If nothing else works, trace the error. His last suggestion is to ask for help so that another person try and replicate the work and find a solution (Long, p. 82).

## Hoelter, L. F., LeClere, F., Pienta, A. M., McNally, J. W., & Barlow, R. E. (2008). Using ICPSR Resources to Teach Sociology. Teaching Sociology, 36, 17-25.

Article can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hjta3dVpWkgRUpiJp4VuQlmOh3NOdAXz/view?usp=drive_link

Problem: Over the last two decades, colleges and universities have taken on the challenge of teaching quantitative literacy (QL) to students in all majors. The social sciences are “particularly well suited to teaching students these skills” because can engage in problem solving with data
(Hoelter et al., p. 17). However, there are challenges to include quantitative literacy in undergraduate classes, such as re-working syllabi and assignments. It is also the case that students are resistant to group work, and faculty and students sometimes have difficulty separating QL from traditional mathematics as they both evoke similar stresses and anxieties. The authors suggest several ways in which the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and its resources can enhance students’ quantitative literacy in coursework and across the undergraduate and graduate curricula. They also discuss several general tools available through the ICPSR website to enhance teaching and research at all levels.

The primary research question in this article:

What are the tools available to aid in the development of a curriculum that teaches undergraduate and graduate students quantitative and statistical literacy skills early in their academic careers?

Definitions:

Quantitative Literacy: The ability to understand and critically evaluate statistical results that permeate our daily lives – coupled with the ability to appreciate the contributions that statistical thinking can make public and private, professional and personal decisions (Hoelter et al., p. 18).

Information Literacy: Finding and critically evaluating information to answer questions

Statistical Literacy: Using statistics as evidence for arguments

Data Literacy: The need to understand and work with data

Workflow: Not found in this article.

Workflow skills: The authors point out several tools available for students to engage in Quantitative Literacy (QL) skills early, such as those found on the ICPSR website. Specifically, using Online Learning Center for undergraduates and Secondary Datasets for graduate students are some ways to teach workflow skills.

Quality of science: In the article, the authors state that asking students to replicate an article of interest in sociology or other fields is a valuable way to socialize students to the expectations and practices of the discipline, teaches them the norms of scientific transparency, and helps them get published early in their careers (Hoelter et al. p. 21).

Efficiency of science: Using the online tools suggested helps students to begin direct replication practices by allowing them to ask research questions that they are interested in and finding an article in a sociological journal of their interest (Hoelter et al. p. 21).

Goals, Resources, and Tools: ICPSR has prioritized making data holdings more accessible to faculty and students. When interviewing faculty in focus groups and in-depth interviews, they specified wanting the ability to 1) quickly locate relevant data that are easy to work with to demonstrate the content(s), and 2) customize any material to their own teaching approach and syllabus. This resulted in the creation of the Online Learning Center (OLC).

The OLC is a teaching/learning module that helps identify relevant, usable datasets quickly. The core of the site is made up of Data-Driven Learning Guides (DDLG’s) - it is set up like a lesson plan and makes use of “real” data from ICPSR holdings. The benefits of this are that no license is required nor do students need to learn statistical software.
 
A New Approach to Teaching Research Methods: The exposure to the scholarly process outside of some isolated journal articles is why students may have a problem coming up with good research questions that lead to the analysis of quantitative data (Hoelter et al., p. 20). Authors suggest a more useful way: “to use a model in which the students analyze not data in the traditional sense but the objects of social science discourse: the scholars, datasets, and publications that compose a network of scholarly exchange” (Hoelter et al., p. 20). A tool called Exploring Data through Research Literacy (EDRL) is available for this.

The Use of Secondary Data in Graduate Courses: Authors contend that asking students to replicate an article of interest is a valuable way to socialize students to the expectations and practices of the discipline (of sociology), and it teaches them the norms of scientific transparency and helps them get published early in their careers (Hoelter et al., p. 21). For this, there are two tools available: 1) the Publication-Related Archive, and 2) the Bibliography of Data-Related Literature.

The paper introduces a new lexicon for research reproducibility. (a) Methods reproducibility, the provision of enough detail about research procedures (e.g. how many analyses were performed) and data. (b) Results reproducibility refers to obtainings the same results from a conduct of an independent study whose procedures are as close as possible. (c) Inferential reproducibility refers to drawing the same conclusions from an either independent study or a reanalysis of the original study.
The article points out some of its basic terms - reproducibility, replicability, reliability, robustness, and generalizability - are not standardized, leading to both conceptual and operational confusion.

Conclusion: Ill-defined reproducibility can be improved by a clear specification of reproducibility (methods, results, or inferences) and how it affects knowledge.
Argument
The researchers need to move toward a better understanding of the relationship between reproducibility, cumulative evidence, and the truth of scientific claims.

**Audience**: Anyone creating datasets; but specific examples are for ecology & evolutionary biology scientists

**Purpose of Article**: To provide tips, recommendations, and resources on how to make your data more shareable for others

**Software**: Python & R; some other recommendations

**Key Definitions**\*:  
Reproducible - no definition  
Replicable - no definition  
workflow - no definition  
quality of science - no definition  
efficiency of science - no definition  
\*The authors provide no key definitions of words found in the article, however, the entire article is devoted to the importance of quality dataset for the purpose of reproducing, replicating, and reusing data.

**Summary**:  
_Introduction_  
Data sharing is becoming a more widely recognized important element of the scientific process for two reasons: “allowing the replication of research results” and the “reuse of meta-analyses and projects not.. intended" by the original data collectors (pg1). However, even if data sharing occurs more, the impact of data sharing will be limited if the shared data is unusable due to structure, metadata, or licensing issues.

_Tip 1 - Share your data_  
Authors note that individuals are reluctant to share their data for a variety of concerns, such as competition over publications from the dataset, lack of giving credit where credit is due, and the idea that sharing data is challenging and time intensive. The authors counter that there are two developments that address these concerns: 1) there are limitations or embargos on data sharing to address the concerns regarding competition and 2) datasets are now citable.

The authors identify four ways sharing data is beneficial to the science community:

*   “(1) the results of existing analyses to be reproduced and improved upon (Fienberg and Martin 1985, Poisot et al. 2013)
*   (2) data to be combined in meta-analyses to reach general conclusions (Fienberg and Martin 1985)
*   (3) new approaches to be applied to the data and new questions asked using it (Fienberg and Martin 1985)
*   (4) approaches to scientific inquiry that could not be considered without broad scale data sharing (Hampton et al. 2013).” (pg 2).

They also discuss how on an individual level, sharing data is beneficial, because it can increase your citation count and allows you to reuse the data in new ways in the future.

_Tip 2 - Provide Metadata_  
The authors define metadata as “information about the data, including how it was collected, what the units of measurement are, and descriptions of how to best use the data (Michener and Jones 2012)” (pg2). Metadata is important, because it provides clarity on how useful a dataset will be for a specific project, it makes the dataset easier to use, and it makes the dataset useful for longer.  

Good meta data should include:

*   “The what, when, where, and how of data collection.
*   How to find and access the data.
*   Suggestions on the suitability of the data for answering specific questions.
*   Warnings about known problems or inconsistencies in the data, e.g., general descriptions of data limitations or a column in a table to indicate the quality of individual data points.
*   Information to check that the data are properly imported, e.g., the number of rows and columns in the dataset and the total sum of numerical columns.” (pg 2)

Metadata can come in many forms, but should be "logically organized, complete, and clear enough to enable interpretation and use of data." (pg 2). The authors recommend following the metadata standards of your field, because that will help with the reusability of your dataset. Developing good metadata starts with describing your data in the planning and collection stages.

Resources for better Metadata

*   KNB Morpho
*   USGS xtme
*   FGDC workbook

_Tip 3 - Provide an unprocessed form of data_  
It is important to provide your data in its most raw form and the clean set you used. The two datasets provide future users with more flexibility. Explain the difference between the two sets in the metadata.

_Tip 4 - Use standard data formats_  
The authors suggest using a standard format to make it easier for others to use your data. Good standards include: File type, overall data structure, and file content.

4.a - Use standard file formats  
The authors suggest using a file format that is readable by most software and when possible is non-proprietary. Additionally, it should be stored in a text file, because proprietary software like Microsoft Excel can be challenging to load in other programs. It can also become old, no longer open and therefore make your data inaccessible in the future.

Additionally, the authors suggest using tables when the data doesn't have a well defined format. Naming files should be consistent, descriptive, and no spaces.

4.b - Use standard table formats  
The authors provide three recommendations on tabular data to make it more accessible when importing on most analysis software or data management systems.

*   “Each row should represent a single observation (i.e., record) and each column should represent a single variable or type of measurement (i.e., field) (Borer et al. 2009, Strasser et al. 2011, 2012).
*   Every cell should contain only a single value (Strasser et al. 2012).
*   There should be only one column for each type of information” (pg 4)

Authors note that the most common violation of these rules is when the researcher uses a cross-tab structure. See “Recommended resources from this section” on resources to address this issue.

4.c - Use standard formats within cells  
Authors provide four recommendations:  

*   “_Be consistent_. For example, be consistent in your capitalization of words, choice of delimiters, and naming conventions for variables.
*   _Avoid special characters_. Most software for storing and analyzing data works best on plain text, and accents and other special characters can make it difficult to import your data (Borer et al. 2009, Strasser et al. 2012).
*   _Avoid using your delimiter in the data itself_ (e.g., commas in the notes filed of a comma-delimited file). This can make it difficult to import your data properly. This means that if you are using commas as the decimal separator (as is often done in continental Europe) then you should use a non- comma delimiter (e.g., a tab).
*   _When working with dates use the YYYY-MM-DD format_ (i.e., follow the ISO 8601 data standard).” (pg 4)

Recommended resources from this section:

*   For naming files recommends camel case or using underscores
*   Tools to restructure cross-tab data to avoid violating the rules in 4.b: “functions in Excel, R (e.g., melt() function in the R package reshape; Wick- ham 2007), and Python (e.g., melt() function in the Pandas Python module…” (pg 4).

_Tip 5 - Use good null valves_  
The authors discuss how working with missing or empty data valves is challenging. Therefore it is important for the original researcher to indicate this missing or empty value with a good null value. The authors recommend selecting a null value that works with as many different softwares as possible and won't cause errors in the analysis. They specifically recommend leaving the cell blank. They do note there are two challenges with using blacks, which are 1) blanks are unclear to the reader if the data is missing or simply overlooked during data entry or 2) Blanks can be confused for spaces and tabs in certain situations. But it is still the best overall.

The inserted chart includes all the authors recommendations for null values.

_Tip 6 - Make it easy to combine your data with other datasets_  
The authors recommend using contextual data to make combining your dataset easier with other datasets. Contextual data is typically data collected in the field, but not necessarily a variable (eg location). They recommend including this data in either the Metadata or as its own column.

The authors provide a lot of information in this section specific to the fields of ecology and biology. It might benefit the reader to check their own field regarding the inclusion and formatting of contextual data.

_Tip 7 - Perform Basic Quality Control_  
The authors note that quality control is important, because it helps decrease the chances of making a mistake in your own work and makes your dataset more usable in the future. The authors note there are both basic and advanced quality control checks that individuals can run. Advanced quality control checks involve more automation; python and R can assist. The authors provide three recommendations for basic quality control:  

*   Check to make sure there are no non-numeric values in a column that should only contain numeric values
*   Confirm that empty cells are not missing a data entry and are actually representing missing data. Indicate the missing data by using the appropriate null.
*   “Check for consistency in unit of measurement, data type (e.g., numeric, character), naming scheme (e.g., taxonomy, location), etc.” (pg 7).

Lastly, the authors recommend having someone review your data, in the same way you may ask someone to review your writing.

_Tip 8 - Use an established repository_  
“For data sharing to be effective, data should be easy to find, accessible, and stored where it will be preserved for a long time (Kowalczyk and Shankar 2011).” (pg 7). Therefore store your data in a repository.  
The authors recommend looking at where other researchers in your discipline publish their data. This will help you with identifying what repositories to use and what the standards are. The authors also suggest that you should look for repositories that have clear and easy to follow instructions and standards around citing work.  
Recommend resources for finding repositories:

*   http://databib.org
*   http://re3data.org.

_Tip 9 - Use an established and open license_  
Include a license with your data that's clear on the "... the rights and responsibilities of both the people providing the data and the people using it ..." and make the licenses as open as possible (pg7). Even minor restrictions have major consequences 2 additional resources for reading. 

Recommended resources for licenses:

*   Panton Principles
*   Creative Commons Zero (CCB)

_Conclusion_  
Data sharing can be transformative for the field of science and therefore there is growing interest in it. More funders are requesting for data to be shared. However, the shift will not be impactful, if others cannot use your data. The provided tips in this article should improve your data and make it more usable for others. The authors also emphasize that these tips are also just general better data practices. These tips can be implemented at any point in the project, but its best to start using them at the start.


## Libes, D. (1989). Choosing a Name for your Computer. Integrated Systems Group, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD.

**Key Words:**

*   Domain name system
*   Naming conventions
*   Computer administration
*   Computer network management

  
**Important note:** This article begins with a Gary Larson cartoon, which should be enough encouragement for anyone to dive right in.  
 

**Summary:**

Naming (e.g., computers, networks, files, etc.) feels like it should be intuitive, but developing good naming conventions requires some thought. Libes outlines what NOT to do:

*   Don’t overload other terms already in common use.
*   Don’t choose a name after a project unique to that machine.
*   Don’t use your own name.
*   Don’t use long names.
*   Avoid alternate spellings.
*   Avoid domain names.
*   Avoid domain-like names.
*   Don’t use antagonistic or otherwise embarrassing names.
*   Don’t use digits at the beginning of the name.
*   Don’t use non-alphanumeric characters in a name.
*   Don’t expect case to be preserved.
*   Use words/names that are rarely used.
*   Use theme names.
*   Use real words.
*   Don’t worry about reusing someone else’s hostname.
*   There is always room for an exception.

Fundamentally, Libes suggests choosing one’s computer name wisely.

D., Chin, G., Christensen, G., Contestabile, M., Dafoe, A., Eich, E., Freese, J., Glennerster, R., Goroff, D., Green, D. P., Hesse, B., Humphreys, M., . . . Yarkoni, T. (2015). Promoting an open research culture. Science, 348(6242), 1422-1425. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aab2374

In Nosek et al, 2015 the authors are members of the Transparency and Openness Promotion Committee, and they advocate for the advancement of these topics in scientific research and publishing. They argue that the primary hindrance to widespread transparency among researchers is the lack of overall incentives from publishers or other bodies to make it a requirement as part of the publishing process. The members (consisting of subject matter experts, publishers, and funding bodies) created a system for citation and declaration of data availability that meets different standards for different types of research and fields, but ultimately promotes transparency. There are four levels covering multiple paper/research component topics in a transparency matrix. (Nosek et al, 2015, p. 1424) The lowest level is Zero, which is when there is little enforcement of additional transparency measures, or the current accepted level is maintained. The highest level is Three, which requires citations and public repository access of any data used, among other things. Ultimately, the system is not intended to require every scientific publication use Level Three in every category or it won’t publish, but that the matrix be used to grade the articles appropriately for each discipline to ensure the appropriate quality of transparency.

**Concepts and Definitions:**  
“**Replication** standards recognize the value of replication for independent verification of research results and identify the conditions under which replication studies will be published in the journal. To progress, science needs both innovation and self-correction; replication offers opportunities for self-correction to more efficiently identify promising research directions.” (Nosek et al, 2015, p. 1423)

“**Reproducibility** increases confidence in results and also allows scholars to learn more about what results do and do not mean. (i) Design standards increase transparency about the research process and reduce vague or incomplete reporting of the methodology. (ii) Research materials standards encourage the provision of all elements of that methodology. (iii) Data sharing standards incentivize authors to make data available in trusted repositories such as Dataverse, Dryad, the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), the Open Science Framework, or the Qualitative Data Repository. (iv) Analytic methods standards do the same for the code comprising the statistical models or simulations conducted for the research.” (Nosek et al, 2015, p. 1423)

A common version control users are familiar with is Google Docs.

The author emphasizes the importance of reproducible workflows in ensuring the quality and efficiency of science. The author suggests that reproducibility can be achieved by providing detailed documentation of the data sources, analytical methods, and software used in the study, as well as making the data and code publicly available.

### **Definitions**

The term "**reproducible**" in the context of research and data analysis typically refers to the ability to recreate or replicate the results of a study or analysis using the same data and methods. The author may define reproducible as ensuring that the processes, methodologies, and analyses conducted in a study are transparent and well-documented so that other researchers can replicate the findings. This transparency allows for verification of results and promotes trust in the research outcomes..

The author discusses the **workflow** in the context of an urban informatics project, emphasizing the importance of understanding the system in which the problem originates and the criticality of problem definition and understanding the problem context in developing usable solutions (Page 388)

**Quality of science** is addressed in terms of the interpretability versus accuracy trade-off in machine learning algorithms, where the author highlights the importance of building trust in data-driven decision making and the need for end-users to understand how the output was produced

### **Ways to measure**

To measure the **workflow** in the article, you can assess the level of transparency in documenting data sources and analytical methods, evaluate the reproducibility of the research findings by checking if data and code are made publicly available, analyze the efficiency of the workflow in terms of time and resource savings, examine the collaboration facilitated by reproducible workflows, and consider how the author emphasizes the importance of reproducibility for enhancing the quality and reliability of scientific research.

In **quality of life**, one can evaluate the robustness of the methodology employed, the transparency of the research process in documenting data sources and analytical methods, the reproducibility of the findings through publicly available data and code, the impact and contribution of the research to the field of urban planning, and the interdisciplinary approach taken to address complex urban challenges. Assessing these aspects will provide insights into the rigor, transparency, significance, and interdisciplinary nature of the scientific research presented in the article.

### **Research question**

Realizing that the credibility of quantitative social science is from the repeatable research results. The economic profession has been taking measures to improve the repeatability. With the development of computing and programming, quantitative social analysis becomes drastically complex. The lack of detail and repeatability could reduce the credibility of quantitative social science. The internet makes it possible for researchers to increase the transparency of research, thus increasing the credibility. By disputing six objections, the author argues that replication could benefit and increase the credibility of quantitative social science, and the cost is acceptable.

ASA: American Sociological Association (ASA) code of ethics, which is just that sociologists should ‘‘permit’’ attempts to verify results after their publication.

AER policy: “Papers could be published _only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication._”

### **Definitions**

**Reproducible** refers to the ability to replicate or reproduce the results of a study using the same data and procedures. It involves making all necessary information, such as data, code, and materials, available to others to verify the presented results.

**Workflow** is defined as the sequence of steps involved in conducting a research study, from data collection to analysis and reporting of results. Freese emphasizes the importance of documenting and sharing this workflow to enhance transparency and replicability in social science research.

These are the skills required to manage and document the workflow of a research project effectively. Researchers are encouraged to develop these skills to ensure that their work is transparent and reproducible.

**Quality of science** means to the credibility and reliability of scientific research. Freese argues that increasing transparency and replication standards in sociology can enhance the quality of science by allowing for the verification of results and promoting the sharing of research materials for further analysis and extension by other researchers

### **Ways to measure**

The **reproducibility** of research findings can be measured by evaluating the extent to which researchers make their data and code available for replication purposes. Compliance with replication policies and standards, such as depositing materials in online archives, can also indicate the level of reproducibility in quantitative social science research. Transparency in reporting methods and decisions made during the research process is crucial for assessing reproducibility. By examining data availability, code sharing, transparency in methods, and adherence to replication policies, the reproducibility of research in sociology can be effectively measured.

Measuring the "**Workflow**" in research involves evaluating the completeness and clarity of documentation, adherence to reproducibility standards, transparency in methods, and compliance with best practices. Researchers can assess the quality of their workflow by documenting data collection, cleaning procedures, analysis steps, and result interpretation. Transparency in reporting methods and adherence to best practices, such as version control and clear communication of the workflow, are essential for ensuring the robustness and reproducibility of research in quantitative social science.: (1) Is the original data provided? (2) Is the code stored?(3) Did the researcher save the syntax, when they use the GUI? (4) Did the researcher document the version information on the data?

## Playford et al. (2016)

Playford, C. J., Gayle, V., Connelly, R., & Gray, A. J. (2016). Administrative social science data: The challenge of reproducible research. Big Data & Society, 3(2). https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951716684143

Playford et al. (2016) address how reproducible workflow skills affect the quality and efficiency of science by emphasizing the importance of a planned and organized workflow, particularly when using administrative data. The authors argue that sharing research code is essential for achieving reproducibility, which enhances the accuracy and validity of analyses, as well as facilitating further testing of research. They advocate for the use of version control software like Git to improve code sharing and make research more reproducible. **The paper highlights that a well-planned workflow and the sharing of research code are critical for improving the overall quality and efficiency of social science research, making it more transparent and reproducible**. The authors also note that the use of syntax files (as opposed to graphical user interfaces) is imperative for reproducibility and transparency.

### **Challenges & Solutions**

- Challenge 1: Lack of code sharing and documentation. Social scientists often don't share their analysis code, which makes research difficult to reproduce. Using point-and-click methods instead of syntax also means that analysis steps aren't recorded.

  Solution 1: Share all research code (syntax files) and any code used to get or combine data. Always use syntax files instead of graphical interfaces to make sure the analysis 
  is recorded.

- Challenge 2: Restrictions on data access and retention. Access restrictions and short data retention periods limit the ability to share data and code.

  Solution 2: Use meta-information and share code to help make research reproducible. Work toward policies that keep data and research code for a long time.

- Challenge 3: Working with changing data. Data from administrative systems can change over time, so it's hard to know exactly which data were used.
  
  Solution 3: Document the code and time parameters used to get the data from the dynamic system.

- Challenge 4: Limited exploratory data analysis when using administrative data.

  Solution 4: Develop better tools to explore this kind of data.

- Challenge 5: Lack of version control. Without version control, it's hard to track changes in code or go back to older versions. Using personal websites or repositories is not 
  ideal.

  Solution 5: Use version control systems like Git to manage code changes. Also, use Research Objects (ROs) to organize all research outputs (data, code, documentation).
