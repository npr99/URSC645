the author emphasizes the importance of reproducible workflows in ensuring the quality and efficiency of science. The author suggests that reproducibility can be achieved by providing detailed documentation of the data sources, analytical methods, and software used in the study, as well as making the data and code publicly available.

### **Research question**

Realizing that the credibility of quantitative social science is from the repeatable research results. The economic profession has been taking measures to improve the repeatability. With the development of computing and programming, quantitative social analysis becomes drastically complex. The lack of detail and repeatability could reduce the credibility of quantitative social science. The internet makes it possible for researchers to increase the transparency of research, thus increasing the credibility. By disputing six objections, the author argues that replication could benefit and increase the credibility of quantitative social science, and the cost is acceptable.

ASA: American Sociological Association (ASA) code of ethics, which is just that sociologists should ‘‘permit’’ attempts to verify results after their publication.

AER policy: “Papers could be published _only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication._”
