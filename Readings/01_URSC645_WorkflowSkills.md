| In-Text Citation | Workflow Skills Defined |
| --- | --- |
| Gentzkow and Shapiro (2014) Ch. 1 | Workflow skills are defined as the ability to organize datasets and write code using methodologies borrowed from software engineering. |
| Gentzkow and Shapiro (2014) Ch. 2 | Workflow skills are measured by the ability to write scripts that tell the operating system how to run a project directory and the discipline to avoid manual data manipulations. |
| Hoelter et al (2008) | Workflow skills include using tools that support quantitative literacy early, such as the ICPSR Online Learning Center for undergraduates and Secondary Datasets for graduate students. |
| Munafo et al (2017) | Workflow skills are presented as workflow-oriented practices that structure research from design to dissemination, including pre-registration of hypotheses and analysis plans, standardized documentation of methods, open sharing of data and code, and collaborative or multi-site study designs. |

### Summary: How Has the Definition of Workflow Skills Evolved?

Across the literature, workflow skills are consistently framed as the capabilities required to organize, automate, and document research processes so that work can be reproduced and extended. The idea begins as a set of practical abilities (organizing data and writing code) and expands to include broader research practices that structure the entire lifecycle of a project.

**Early definitions (2008-2014)** emphasize practical skills and tools. Hoelter et al (2008) focus on tools that help students engage workflow-related skills early. Gentzkow and Shapiro (2014) define workflow skills as the ability to organize datasets and write code, then operationalize them through scripting and avoidance of manual data edits.

**By 2017**, workflow skills broaden to include **research practices**. Munafo et al (2017) present workflow skills as practices that structure research from design to dissemination, including pre-registration, standardized documentation, and open sharing of data and code. This shifts workflow skills from a narrow technical focus to a broader research-culture emphasis.

**Key areas of agreement:**
- Workflow skills require organizing data and documenting analysis steps
- Scripting and automation are central to effective workflow skills
- Workflow skills support transparency, reuse, and reproducibility

**Key areas of evolution:**
- From technical skills (organizing data, writing code) to full lifecycle practices (pre-registration, documentation standards, sharing)
- From tool-specific skills to broader research practices that shape the workflow itself

In summary, workflow skills have expanded from practical data-and-code abilities into a wider set of practices that structure transparent, reproducible research from start to finish.
