# Course Syllabus
Course title and number:	URSC 645 Urban and Regional Analytics

---
## Course Description and Prerequisites
---

**Course catalog description:** Urban and regional administrative data management; data analysis; programming for replicable, systematic research; project workflow to support project collaboration 

**Course Purpose:** The purpose of this course is to apply urban analytics tools, such as tools for data management and visualization, to publicly available data that relate to development, structure, and functioning of urban and regional environments. The course introduces data workflow skills to obtain, scrub, explore, visualize, interpret and publish data. 

The course focuses on computer coding skills to ensure that research is replicable, systematic and generalizable.

This course will familiarize Urban and Regional Science and Sociology PhD students with data management concepts for reproducible research. Computer coding or scripting is the basis for a data science workflow that leads to systematic research that can be replicated and generalized. Reproducible research means that results can be validated by other researchers, when provided with the data and software code used to generate the published results. This course will guide students through the challenges associated with reproducible research.  

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this class, students will be able to:
-	Demonstrate that they understand basic applications for code and scripts.
-	Adopt a scalable workflow for individual and team-based projects. 
-	Identify replicable research in sociology or urban and regional science journals.
-	Use appropriate software to obtain, scrub, explore, visualize, interpret and publish data.

## Course Motivations

In the typical statistics course students work with clean, orderly datasets. However, when students begin to do their own research they are faced with real-world-raw data that is far from clean and orderly. Often, the process of generating a clean dataset requires a large time investment and for many projects this data cleaning process can take more time than the data modeling and interpretation. This course was motivated in part by seeing students struggle with real world data. 

For many graduate students in the fields of sociology and urban and regional science, coding, scripting, and visualization tools are not introduced in undergraduate programs. However, many students and faculty discover that coding skills are essential for systematic, generalizable, and replicable research. This course attempts to provide the motivation and the foundation for building a strong workflow to support urban and regional analytic research.
